# Description
SmtpJoker allows you to create and execute basic phishing mails as jokes to set up your friends.
Through the app you will be able to create a group of "victims" which will contain one sender, whose address will be the one supposed to be sending the message, and the
the others will be the receivers.

# MockMock
MockMock is a simulated SMTP server which was used to test the transmission of messages in large quantities while avoiding annoying traffic on a real server. This tool allowed us to implement our solution step by step while verifying its proper functioning while performing a large number of tests.
