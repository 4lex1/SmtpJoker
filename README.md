# Description
SmtpJoker allows you to create and execute basic phishing mails as jokes to set up your friends.
Through the app you will be able to create a group of "victims" which will contain one sender, whose address will be the one supposed to be sending the message, and the
the others will be the receivers.

# MockMock
MockMock is a simulated SMTP server which was used to test the transmission of messages in large quantities while avoiding annoying traffic on a real server. This tool allowed us to implement our solution step by step while verifying its proper functioning while performing a large number of tests. 

# Setting up your mock SMTP server
Here is a quick guide that will allow you to run a Mock SMTP server, MockMock in this case, in order to test *SmtpJoker* while avoiding the risks that could result from a joke that would have gone wrong. In order to optimize the performance of the tool, we advise you to run it in a Docker container. To do so, follow the steps described below:
